## Handwritten Digit Recognition with KNeighborsClassifier

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition model using the KNeighborsClassifier algorithm from scikit-learn.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from images. The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled images and then evaluated on a separate test set. KNeighborsClassifier is a simple yet effective algorithm that classifies data points based on their similarity to labeled data points in the training set.

### Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

* scikit-learn
* NumPy
* matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
```

### Usage

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://your_repository_url.git
   ```

### Output

The script will output the following:

* Training accuracy of the model
* Testing accuracy of the model
* Visualization of predictions (using heatmaps from matplotlib)

### Further Improvements

* Experiment with different hyperparameters for KNeighborsClassifier (e.g., number of neighbors).
* Try other machine learning algorithms for comparison (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forest).
* Implement data preprocessing steps for better performance.
* Visualize the learned decision boundaries of the model.

This is a basic framework for a handwritten digit recognition project using KNeighborsClassifier. You can extend it further to explore more advanced techniques and applications.
